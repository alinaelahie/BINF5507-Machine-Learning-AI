Data Preprocessing for Messy Dataset

Project Overview:
In this project, I will be implementing various data preprocessing techniques in Python to clean and prepare a messy dataset (messy_data.csv). These techniques will address missing values, redundant features, and other data quality issues. The goal is to process the data, apply transformations, and evaluate the impact of these preprocessing steps on the dataset's usability and performance. 

Technologies Used:
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Matplotlib/Seaborn

Installation Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate into the project directory
3. Set up a virtual environment (optional)
4. Install required dependencies 

Usage:
Once you have the repository setup and the required dependencies you can run the Jupyter Notebook to test the preprocessing methods.

Preprocessing Methods:
1. Missing Values
2. Removing Redundant Values
3. Data Normalization/Scaling
